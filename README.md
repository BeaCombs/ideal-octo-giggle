learning and misc.

I am a human who is learning how to make digital ecosystems.  I am doing this so we can talk about those ecosystems, and potentially save them from environmental collapse, due to... humans.  

I will use this repository in my learning, mostly for personal things, so I don't clog my other work with misc. thoughts.  

Every day I am battling an urge to get on my sailboat with my dogs and fiance and sail to French Polynesia.
